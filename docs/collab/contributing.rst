Contributing
============

``preprocess`` is an open source project that is supported by his author who will gratefully and humbly accept any contributions you might make to the project. Large or small, any contribution makes a big difference.

Principally, ``preprocess`` development is about the addition and creation of *preprocessing* --- functions that takes an original string and transform it to new string with the features that the documented preprocessing technique indicates. Some preprocessing techniques are important in a reduced research area, but **pipeline** function could help to organize more precisely experiments or services. The added function must be simple to use

Beyond creating techniques, there are many ways to contribute:

- Submit a bug report or feature request on `GitHub issues`_.
- Contribute an Jupyter notebook to our `examples gallery`_.
- Assist us with :doc:`user testing <evaluation>`.
- Write unit or integration tests for our project.
- Answer questions on our `GitHub issues`_, `Stack Overflow`_.
- Translate our documentation into another language.
- Write a blog post, tweet, or share our project with others.
- Teach someone how to use Preprocess.

As you can see, there are lots of ways to get involved and we would be very happy for you to join me! The only thing I ask is that you abide by the principles of openness, respect, and consideration of others as described in our :doc:`code_of_conduct`.
